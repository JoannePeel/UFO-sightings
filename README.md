# UFO-sightings

## Automatic Table and Date Search

For this challenge I have used a basic bootstrap template to create a html webpage.

Using the UFO dataset, I have written a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

A date form in the HTML document allows to listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input, using JavaScript.

## Multiple Search Categories

Using multiple input tags, the user can also set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:


* date/time
* city
* state
* country

Finally, if there is no match for the user input, the following response will show:
