# UFO-sightings

## Automatic Table and Date Search

Create a basic HTML web page.

Using the UFO dataset, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.


Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.


Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

## Multiple Search Categories

Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:



* date/time
* city
* state
* country
